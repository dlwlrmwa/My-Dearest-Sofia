        To my love,<br /><br />
        happy four months, baby kooo! hawjhajhwha you must've thought i'd let our special day slip by just coz galing
        tayo nag swimming and we got home tired. no way.<br /><br />
        i keep thinking about last night—how you kissed me so gently, your fingers through my hair. that even though i
        was too sleepy to open my eyes, i felt you. i felt your gaze on me, and i felt so loved. and the little kid
        inside me smiled so wide, up until now. it felt like your love was wrapped around me like a warm blanket. we
        don’t get to sleep next to each other every day, but when we do, we cherish those moments so
        sweetly.<br /><br />
        i love how you always make me feel so special, even in the simplest ways. like when you hold my hand, when you
        laugh at my silly jokes, even when you just laugh at me bisag wala pa gani ko'y gibuhat T^T you make me feel
        like the luckiest person in the world, and i can't imagine my life without you.<br /><br />
        i love you sooo much, my love. i love the way you always choose me, even when i’m not at my best. i love how you
        understand me, sometimes more than i understand myself. i love us and your love that makes me feel safe, calm,
        and cared for. thank you for being you, for being my partner, my best friend, and my lover in one. i am so
        grateful for every moment we share together.<br /><br />
        here's to many more months and years of love, laughter, and happiness together. again, happy four months!
